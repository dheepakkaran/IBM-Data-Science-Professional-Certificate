### 🔹 Module 5: Peer-Graded Assignment
This final module was all about applying what we learned throughout the course — and doing it in the most realistic way: inside a Jupyter Notebook. The task was to create a notebook using IBM Watson Studio (or any notebook platform), where we had to write markdown text, add code cells, and include basic comments. The goal wasn’t to build a complex project but to prove that we could work in a notebook environment, use markdown properly, and show some awareness of tools and languages introduced in earlier modules. There weren’t any difficult algorithms here — the challenge was about getting comfortable with the workflow and presentation style used in the real world.

This assignment was definitely beginner-friendly, but it had a bit of a “professional touch”. It felt like I was preparing a mini-report, not just completing a course. Personally, I enjoyed this module a lot because it felt like I was finally stepping into the shoes of a data scientist, even if just at a basic level. I also had to review notebooks submitted by other learners, and that peer review part was very eye-opening. I saw different ways people structured their notebooks, how they explained things, and even how they handled markdown styling.

I found this module very useful not just for the content but for the experience of sharing my work and getting feedback. It trained me to think about clarity, formatting, and how others read my code — which is something that’ll help me in both job interviews and real-world projects.

After completing this module, I walked away with my first clean Jupyter notebook uploaded, shared, and peer-reviewed. That feeling of publishing something, even if small, felt awesome — like my data science journey had properly kicked off 🚀📓
