### üîπ Module 1: Introducing the Course
This module was a short and simple orientation that set the tone for what‚Äôs coming. It introduced the objectives of the course and what learners should expect in terms of content and flow. It gave an overview of why open source tools are important in data science, especially because they make data work accessible, flexible, and community-driven. The tools mentioned included Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, Apache Zeppelin, and others, but there was no hands-on yet. I‚Äôd say this was a pure beginner-level module ‚Äî no prior experience needed at all. Personally, I found this module very chill, like a warm-up jog before the workout. It helped me see that this course would focus more on practical tools, which was exciting after the conceptual first course. It was useful because it clarified that open-source tools are not just ‚Äúfree alternatives,‚Äù but actually industry-grade tools trusted by big players in data science. After completing this module, I had a good sense of direction: we‚Äôll be exploring not just tools, but also how they help with collaboration, documentation, and reproducibility in data projects. This module didn‚Äôt teach anything too deep, but it laid the foundation clearly. It also built up my interest in learning Jupyter Notebooks, because they were introduced as a popular platform for interactive data science work. In short, this intro was light and useful, setting me up mentally for what‚Äôs next.
