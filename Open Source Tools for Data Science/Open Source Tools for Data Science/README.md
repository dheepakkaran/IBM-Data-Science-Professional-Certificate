### ðŸ”¹ Module 2: Open Source Tools for Data Science
This module was the real kickstart of the course and introduced some of the most widely used tools in the data science world. It covered both open-source tools and cloud-based platforms, and I was surprised by how many there were â€” some I had heard of, others were completely new. The tools included Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, Apache Zeppelin, Git, GitHub, Watson Studio, and more. It also briefly introduced languages like Python, R, Scala, and SQL, and how each one fits into the data science ecosystem. The best part was that it didnâ€™t just name-drop tools â€” it actually explained what role each one plays, like who uses them, what theyâ€™re good for, and in which stage of the data science pipeline they shine. This module is still beginner-level, but it gives a very practical and applied feel compared to earlier conceptual modules.

Personally, this module helped me connect a lot of dots. For example, Iâ€™ve used Git before, but never understood how essential version control is in collaborative data projects. Seeing how GitHub integrates with Jupyter and other tools was a big learning moment for me. I also liked the comparisons â€” like how Zeppelin and Jupyter are both notebook-style tools but have different strengths. This module was extremely useful, especially for someone like me whoâ€™s building hands-on experience and wants to know which tools to master first.

After completing this module, I walked away with a mental map of the open-source universe in data science. It helped me realise that being a good data scientist isnâ€™t just about learning Python or ML, but also about choosing and using the right tools for the job. This module really laid that groundwork for me.
