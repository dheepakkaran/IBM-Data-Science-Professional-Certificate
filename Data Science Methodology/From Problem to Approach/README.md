### ðŸ”¹ Module 1: From Problem to Approach
This module sets the tone for what the rest of the course is all about â€” the thought process behind solving real-world problems using data. It introduces the data science methodology, specifically focusing on the first few stages: problem definition and identifying the analytical approach. There were no tools or programming here, but instead, the focus was on understanding what kind of problem youâ€™re dealing with â€” classification, regression, clustering, etc. It also teaches you to ask the right questions: What is the business objective? What outcome do we want from the data? I learned about the importance of framing a question properly before even thinking about data collection.

For me personally, this module felt very different â€” in a good way. It forced me to think strategically like a consultant rather than just a coder. It made me realise that a poorly defined problem will always lead to poor results, no matter how good your algorithm is. The module is beginner-friendly but very mindset-shifting. There was an example involving predicting customer churn, which helped me relate to a real business problem and understand how to approach it step by step.

I found it super useful because I now know how critical this stage is. After completing this module, I gained the ability to pause and think before I code â€” a habit I know will benefit me long-term in any data project.
