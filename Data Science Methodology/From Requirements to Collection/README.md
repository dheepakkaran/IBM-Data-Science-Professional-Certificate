ðŸ”¹ Module 2: From Requirements to Collection
In this module, the focus shifts from defining the problem to figuring out what data we need, where to get it, and how to collect it. It talks about the importance of data requirements, and how a good understanding of the business goal helps you decide what kind of data you need â€” structured, unstructured, transactional, time-series, etc. The module also covered data sources, such as internal company databases, sensors, APIs, and open data portals. One useful thing I learned was how understanding the granularity of data is important â€” for example, customer-level vs. product-level data. No specific tools were introduced yet, but the ideas shared in this module are core to every real data science workflow.

From my personal experience, this module gave me a deeper appreciation for the data collection phase. Earlier I used to think collecting data was a one-time step, but now I know itâ€™s actually an ongoing part of a project that involves collaboration with stakeholders, business analysts, and sometimes even engineers. This module is again beginner-friendly, but it opens your eyes to real project struggles, like having missing data, wrong data types, or limited access.

I found this module extremely useful because it made me think of data not just as "input," but as something that must be designed around the problem. The examples used â€” like predicting product demand or analysing customer reviews â€” helped me relate everything to practical industry problems.

After completing this module, I became more aware that data science is not just about working with data, but about working for a purpose. This mindset will definitely help me when I approach data collection in future projects or even interviews where they test problem-solving approach.
