### ðŸ”¹ Module 6: Final Assignment
This final module is where all the thinking from the previous five modules gets packaged into a single peer-reviewed assignment. The task is simple but meaningful: explain the data science methodology in your own words, apply it to a sample business scenario (like predicting customer churn), and demonstrate your understanding of each stage â€” from problem definition to deployment. Thereâ€™s no coding or notebook submission here. Itâ€™s a written assignment, and you also get to review and rate assignments submitted by your peers, which adds an extra layer of learning.

For me, this module was a full-circle moment. After soaking in all the theory and industry examples, this assignment gave me the chance to put myself in the role of a data scientist, thinking through how I would solve a problem from scratch. It challenged me to connect each step logically â€” like defining the problem first, then identifying what data is needed, and how to model and deploy it effectively. Even though it was a written piece, it felt like a mini project where I had to apply everything I learned.

I found this module very useful, especially because it forced me to slow down and reflect. Also, reviewing peers' submissions exposed me to different styles of thinking â€” some were very business-focused, others more technical. It reminded me that thereâ€™s no one right way, but clarity of thought and structured reasoning always win.

After completing this module, I felt more confident in how I approach real-world data problems. This wasnâ€™t just a test â€” it was proof that I now understand how data science is more than models, itâ€™s about process, purpose, and delivery.
