### 🔹 Module 4: From Modeling to Evaluation
This module introduces the core part of any data science pipeline — building predictive models and evaluating their performance. It explains how to select the right model based on the problem type: classification, regression, clustering, etc. It also talks about the importance of splitting data into training, testing, and validation sets, and how that helps avoid overfitting. We’re introduced to common techniques like cross-validation and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, RMSE, and more. Though there’s no actual coding in this module, it lays a very solid foundation for understanding how machine learning works conceptually.

For me, this was one of the most exciting modules in the course. It was the first time I truly saw how all the previous steps — understanding the problem, collecting and cleaning data — lead up to this point: making data-driven predictions. I had already heard words like “model accuracy” and “F1-score” in tutorials, but this module helped me understand when and why to use each metric. For example, I now know that accuracy isn’t enough in imbalanced datasets — precision and recall matter more in those cases.

I found this module extremely useful, especially because it framed modeling not as a one-time task but as an iterative, experimental process. It taught me that building a model isn’t just about running an algorithm — it's about understanding your data deeply, tuning parameters carefully, and measuring success thoughtfully.

After completing this module, I gained a lot more confidence in evaluating model performance. I now approach model results with more clarity — knowing what to look for, what’s good, what’s misleading, and how to improve. This was the module that made me feel like I’m officially stepping into the machine learning zone 🚀📊
