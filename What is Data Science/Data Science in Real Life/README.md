### ðŸ”¹ Module 3: Data Science in Real Life
This module focused on how data science is being applied in the real world across different industries, and honestly, this is where the excitement really kicks in. It included detailed stories and insights from real data scientists working in companies like IBM, and covered domains like healthcare, retail, finance, media, and sports. The content was still non-technical â€” no coding or tools yet â€” but it helped me connect theory to real-world impact. This module is still beginner level, but itâ€™s more practical and engaging compared to the earlier ones. One of the standout parts was a video from a data scientist who shared how she worked on building a solution that helps reduce hospital readmission rates â€” that hit differently because it showed how data saves lives. Personally, I found this module super inspiring. It made me realize that data science is not just about career growth or cool projects, but also about creating solutions that actually make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives. It also showed me how versatile the field is â€” from analysing customer behaviour to predicting diseases and even enhancing sports performance. This module was very useful for me, especially because Iâ€™m someone who likes working on real-world problems, and it validated that Iâ€™m on the right path. I also liked how they kept it simple but powerful â€” every example helped me visualize the work better. After completing this module, I gained a better understanding of what kind of industries I might want to work in, and what kind of data problems excite me the most. It definitely boosted my motivation to dive deeper into data science tools in the upcoming courses.
