### ðŸ”¹ Module 1: Introduction to Data Science
This module was a smooth starting point for understanding what data science actually means in the real world. It introduced me to the concept of how data is everywhere and how it drives decisions in fields like business, healthcare, finance, and even sports. There werenâ€™t any heavy tools or coding yet, but the focus was on defining data science, the role of a data scientist, and how they differ from analysts and engineers. The course featured short videos by professionals working at IBM, which made it feel more grounded. Since this is the first module, itâ€™s definitely beginner level, and even someone with zero technical background could easily follow. For me, this module was a kind of "mind opener" â€“ it made me see the bigger picture of what Iâ€™m getting into. I liked how they broke the stereotype that a data scientist just writes models â€” instead, they are storytellers, problem solvers, and decision influencers. It was useful because it helped me mentally prepare for the rest of the journey. I also liked the short reflection exercises that made me think deeper about the field. After finishing this module, I understood that data science is not just about tools, itâ€™s about questions and curiosity. That mindset helped me approach the rest of the course differently. So overall, this module was light, engaging, and gave me a strong foundation.
