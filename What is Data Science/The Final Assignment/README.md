### ðŸ”¹ Module 4: The Final Assignment
This final module was more of a wrap-up and self-check than a typical lesson, but it played a key role in locking in what Iâ€™d learned. It didnâ€™t involve any new concepts or technical tools â€” no coding, no fancy dashboards â€” but instead, it asked us to reflect on everything covered across the first three modules. The main task was a peer-reviewed written assignment where we had to answer a few questions like: What does a data scientist do? How is data science applied in the real world? And what is your understanding of the data science methodology? Even though it might sound basic, this module was a nice checkpoint for me. It made me go back, think through what I had learned, and put it into my own words â€” which I believe is one of the best ways to learn. The level here was definitely beginner, and very accessible. Personally, I enjoyed the chance to write down my thoughts. It was the first time I felt like I could actually explain data science to someone else without sounding confused or unsure. Thatâ€™s a big confidence boost, especially after just one course. I found this module useful, not because of the content, but because of the practice of reflection. It forced me to connect the dots: concepts + real-world use cases + methodology = complete picture. After submitting the assignment, reading other peer responses also gave me different perspectives. Overall, it gave me a moment to pause, review my progress, and feel proud about getting started. This final step helped me walk into the next course with more clarity and excitement.
