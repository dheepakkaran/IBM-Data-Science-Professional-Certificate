### ðŸ”¹ Module 2: What Data Scientists Do
This module gave me a proper inside look at the day-to-day life of a data scientist. It explained how data scientists donâ€™t just sit and code models all day â€” instead, they follow a structured process to solve problems, starting from understanding the business challenge to presenting insights. I got to learn about the Data Science Methodology, which includes steps like defining the problem, collecting data, cleaning it, doing exploratory analysis, modeling, evaluation, and communicating the results. Even though there was no hands-on tool in this module, it made me understand how important the thinking process is in data projects. The module is at a beginner level, but the content feels very thoughtful and slightly strategic. For me personally, this was a very eye-opening module. I used to think data science was mostly about Python and machine learning, but this module changed that. It showed me that having domain understanding and asking the right questions is even more important than writing perfect code. The instructor also shared some real-life examples, like how data scientists in marketing help companies identify customer churn or target users more effectively. I found this module extremely useful because it gave me a clear idea of how the theory Iâ€™ll be learning later connects to practical use cases. It made me realise that data science is not linear; itâ€™s more like a cycle with back-and-forth thinking. After completing this module, I felt more confident about how to approach a data problem step by step, rather than jumping straight into coding. It was more about learning to think like a data scientist, and that mindset shift will definitely help me throughout my journey.
