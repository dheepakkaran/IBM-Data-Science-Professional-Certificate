### ðŸ”¹ Module 1: Python Basics
This module was my official entry into the Python world, and it felt like opening a toolkit that Iâ€™ll carry for the rest of my data science journey. The content started with Python syntax, variables, and simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Then it moved to working with strings, numbers, and type conversions. The module also explained how Python is used in data science and why itâ€™s so popular: readability, rich libraries, and strong community support. The technologies here were all core Python â€” no fancy external libraries yet â€” but it set a very strong foundation.

The level of this module is clearly beginner, but even as someone with prior coding experience, I found it refreshing. Python is very different from Java (which I had used before), especially in how concise and readable it is. I personally enjoyed trying out the examples in Jupyter Notebook â€” being able to run small code snippets cell by cell made learning smooth and interactive. It didnâ€™t feel like a boring theory class; it was more like solving small puzzles and instantly seeing results.

I found this module extremely useful. Often, people rush straight into Pandas or machine learning, but this step ensured I had a solid grasp of the core syntax and logic before moving forward. The exercises were well designed to reinforce learning. I particularly liked the quiz questions because they tested not just memorization but actual understanding.

After completing this module, I gained a strong sense of comfort in writing basic Python code. I could now confidently declare variables, manipulate strings, and handle basic operations without secondâ€‘guessing myself. It felt like I had sharpened my pencil before starting to draw â€” a crucial step before diving into real data manipulation.
