### ðŸ”¹ Module 3: Python Programming Fundamentals
This module built the backbone of coding in Python by diving into control structures, loops, and functions. It started with conditional statements like if, elif, and else, teaching me how to make my code respond to different conditions. Then it introduced loops â€” both for loops and while loops â€” which made repetitive tasks feel effortless. The most powerful part was learning about functions: how to define them with def, pass parameters, return values, and even use default arguments. This module also touched on concepts like local vs global variables and debugging errors with clear examples.

The level here is still beginner, but the workload and thinking definitely stepped up. Unlike the earlier modules, where I was just storing and retrieving data, this one pushed me to think logically and dynamically. Personally, I really enjoyed this module because it gave me the freedom to write custom logic instead of relying only on pre-built functions. I tested my knowledge by writing small programs like checking if a number is prime, looping through lists, and building reusable functions to calculate averages. Using Jupyter Notebook made this practice easy â€” I could quickly test a function, tweak it, and re-run it until it worked.

This module was super useful because it laid the foundation for problem-solving. I realized that in real data projects, you donâ€™t just manipulate values â€” you design solutions that must handle multiple scenarios. Learning to write my own functions made me feel like I had leveled up from a beginner to someone who can structure code like a pro.

After completing this module, I felt confident in writing programs that could automate repetitive tasks and handle decision-making. This will be invaluable when working with data cleaning scripts, analytics logic, and eventually machine learning workflows.
