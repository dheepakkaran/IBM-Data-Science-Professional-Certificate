### ðŸ”¹ Module 4: Working with Data in Python
This module was all about taking Python skills and applying them to real datasets. It introduced libraries like Pandas and NumPy, which are the backbone of almost every data science project. The lessons showed how to create and manipulate DataFrames (basically Excel sheets on steroids), perform operations like filtering, grouping, sorting, and aggregating, and how to handle CSV and JSON files for data input and output. It also covered basic data cleaning â€” fixing missing values, dropping duplicates, and converting data types. The module even touched on descriptive statistics using Pandas, which gave a taste of how analysis is done before visualization or modeling.

The course level here was still beginner, but I could feel it moving towards intermediate, especially with the introduction of Pandas syntax. Personally, I found this module super engaging because it felt like I was finally working with data, not just abstract concepts. The moment I loaded a CSV file and saw it display neatly in a DataFrame inside Jupyter Notebook, it gave me a sense of being a real data scientist. I enjoyed experimenting with commands like .head(), .describe(), .groupby(), and .loc[] â€” it felt powerful to control datasets so easily.

This module was extremely useful because it gave me the practical skills Iâ€™ll need in almost every project. I realised that Pandas is not just a tool but a complete ecosystem for handling structured data. The practice exercises pushed me to solve small but realistic tasks like cleaning up a messy dataset and calculating averages.

After completing this module, I gained the ability to confidently import, clean, and manipulate data â€” a skill that I know will carry over directly into analytics and machine learning. This was the module where Python truly transformed from a coding language into a data science toolkit.
