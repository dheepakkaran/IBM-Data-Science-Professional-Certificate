### ðŸ”¹ Module 5: APIs, Data Collection, and Final Project
This last module was a proper handsâ€‘on wrapâ€‘up, tying together everything Iâ€™d learned so far. It introduced the concept of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and how theyâ€™re used to pull realâ€‘time data into Python. I learned about making HTTP requests with Python and parsing JSON responses â€” skills that are essential for working with live data sources like weather feeds, financial data, or social media. The module also covered web scraping basics, showing how to extract data from websites when APIs arenâ€™t available. Finally, it led into the final project, where I had to apply all the concepts â€” data handling, cleaning, analysis, and basic visualization â€” inside a Jupyter Notebook.

The level here felt more intermediate compared to earlier modules, because I had to integrate multiple skills: coding, data manipulation, and documenting results. Personally, I loved this module because it finally made me feel like a real data scientist. Pulling data from an API and seeing it update in my notebook was exciting â€” itâ€™s no longer static CSVs, but live, dynamic data. The final project gave me the freedom to experiment, make mistakes, and showcase what Iâ€™d learned in a structured notebook.

This module was super useful because it taught me how real-world data rarely comes pre-packaged. I understood how APIs are bridges between data and analysis, and why skills like web scraping can be powerful when APIs arenâ€™t provided. The peerâ€‘graded final project also made me practice explaining my steps in markdown, which is a skill Iâ€™ll need in job interviews and collaborative projects.

After completing this module, I felt confident that I could find, collect, and work with data on my own. It was the perfect conclusion to this course, proving that Iâ€™m ready to move beyond theory into solving real problems with Python.
