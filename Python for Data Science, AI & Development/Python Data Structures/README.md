### ðŸ”¹ Module 2: Python Data Structures
This module focused on the core data structures in Python: lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. It showed how each structure works, when to use them, and their real-world applications in data science. For example, lists for storing ordered collections, tuples for immutable records, dictionaries for key-value mappings (like JSON), and sets for unique elements. The module also explained how to perform operations such as slicing lists, nesting structures, dictionary lookups, and using built-in functions like len(), append(), and remove(). The highlight was seeing how dictionaries and lists together can represent complex datasets, which is exactly what weâ€™ll face later in data wrangling.

This module was still beginner level, but the complexity definitely increased compared to Module 1. Personally, I found it exciting because the examples felt more practical â€” like storing student grades in dictionaries or using lists to process sequences of values. Working through this in Jupyter Notebooks gave me instant feedback whenever I made a mistake, which was motivating. I especially enjoyed exercises that asked me to combine different structures, like a list of dictionaries, because they felt closer to how real datasets are structured.

This module was very useful for me because it taught me how choosing the right data structure makes coding easier and more efficient. Earlier, I might have tried to force everything into a list, but now I see the power of dictionaries when working with labeled data, or sets when I need unique values. It also helped me understand how data science libraries like Pandas are built on these core structures.

After completing this module, I felt much more confident in handling structured data. I can now create, modify, and use these data structures effectively, which I know will help a lot when I start working with data frames and APIs in the next modules.
