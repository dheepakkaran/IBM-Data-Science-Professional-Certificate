# 👋 Hey there! I’m Deepak – Your Friendly Data Science Explorer 👨‍💻🚀

I’m an Electrical and Electronics grad who took a wild turn into the world of **data, code, and intelligent predictions**.  
After some time coding APIs and scaling microservices in the IT jungle 🌴, I dove deep into the ocean of **data science** with IBM's Professional Certificate.

> 🎯 Why? Because data tells stories. And I want to become the guy who understands and retells them with insight, empathy, and a bit of swagger 😎.
